This repository contains some projects I did in [**DataCamp**](https://learn.datacamp.com/). I will make portfolio from this repository.

## Project 1 : [Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa?](https://github.com/thomaspanji/projects/blob/main/breath_alcohol_ames.ipynb)

Using data collected from the State of Iowa, I group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions I answer include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

## Project 2 : [Analyzing TV Data](https://github.com/thomaspanji/projects/blob/main/office_episodes.ipynb)

<p><strong>The Office!</strong> What started as a British mockumentary series about office culture in 2001 has since spawned ten other variants across the world, including an Israeli version (2010-13), a Hindi version (2019-), and even a French Canadian variant (2006-2007). Of all these iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.</p>
<p>In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, we will use the following dataset: <code>datasets/office_episodes.csv</code>, which was downloaded from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset">here</a>.</p>
