# projects
This repository contains some projects I did in [**DataCamp**](https://learn.datacamp.com/). I will make portfolio from this repository.

## Project 1 : [Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa?](https://github.com/thomaspanji/projects/blob/main/breath_alcohol_ames.ipynb)

Using data collected from the State of Iowa, I group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions I answer include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"
